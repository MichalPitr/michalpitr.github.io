# Why you get demotivated doing LeetCode

<i>"You have to do LeetCode"</i>, you hear this all the time. Everyone expects you to do LeetCode problems nowadays. If you don't do LeetCode last thing in the evening, 
there's something wrong with you. You tried LeetCode, afterall, if it's so important, why wouldn't you. But it is hard. You were probably asked to do something with
graphs or linked lists, things you rarely if every use in your own projects. You probably asked yourself, <i>"Am I not smart enough for this?"</i>. This leads to demotivation. 

Let me tell you that LeetCode creates unrealistic expectations, especially for early undergraduates. I would recommend puttin LeetCodes aside and instead getting familiar with
algorithms and datastructures. You may have taken an algorithms and datastructures class, but it may have concerned itself more with big O notation and not so 
much with actual coding. You can pick any of the numerous resources on coding interview prep, e.g. "Cracking the Coding Interview". The resource should introduce the reader to 
the most common types of questions and how to tackle them. It should also presents you with questions that you, given some thought, CAN solve. Only then would I recommend you to
go on to LeetCode and grind through questions.  

You may grow to like algorithms questions, afterall, now you will have a good shot at solving them! I went from considering LeetCode my worst enemy to 
appreciating it for what it is.
