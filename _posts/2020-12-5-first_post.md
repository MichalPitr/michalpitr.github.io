# How, Why, and What?

I was looking for blog post on best data science practices by Jeremy Howard, the founder of FastAI, and stumbled upon his post arguing why
*I* should start blogging. In a nutshell, he argues that blogging is a good benchmark of your understanding of any concept you try to write about and *could* help you get exposure/land a job. As Jeremy provides an absurdly easy way to get started, I had to at least consider the benefits.

As a 2nd-year CS  & Maths undergraduate student struggling with finding internships in the field of Data Science, I decided that it would be a good way to practice 
writing skills, which, like it or not, are an essential life skill. Moreover, I get to write about the topics *I* enjoy, such as AI/ML, MOOCs, and my experience as
an undergraduate student.

I may, *very likely*, end up abandoning this blog, but if not, and *you* happen to stumble upon this, then the blog has exceeded its wildest expectations.
