# Applying to internships

I figured I'd fill my course engagement blog entry by sharing what I have learned over the past two years of applying to internships. 
Since coding assessments are usually based on algorithms, I think could be of use to anyone actively looking, thinking about it, 
or perhaps just wanting to compare their approach to applying. In this post, I will show what my effort has yielded, describe how I went about applying,
and point out some of the frustration associated with applications.

In my first year, I applied to several UK and Czech companies and scored two offers: one from a large Czech bespoke software company and another one 
in an NLP research team at a Czech university. As getting an internship with a focus on deep learning was my aim during my search,
I went with the latter. I worked on automatic fact-checking using Transformer networks. My focus was on using transformer networks for 
semantic information retrieval. This year I started applying in early September and applied to easily over 100 companies in the UK, US,
Czechia, Japan, and Europe. Surely that many applications must have netted me a lot of offers, right? Well, not quite.
Actually, not at all. Many companies have ghosted me. Many have rejected me. Some have rejected me after a single interview,
while some have taken me through rounds upon rounds of coding assessments and interviews but ultimately rejected me. One has offered me a
position: Canon Medical Research Europe, a research center in Edinburgh focused on the application of AI in Medicine. My internship there will 
focus on memory augmented networks for knowledge injection.


The first-year internship offer I received from the bespoke software company was done by contacting the company's owner directly via email. 
This scored me an interview and an eventual offer. For the NLP project, I applied by contacting the research institute via email. 
They matched me with a researcher based on my interests who interview me. For my upcoming internship, I applied last year but got rejected. 
When I reapplied this year with more experience under my belt, they decided to interview me. The interview was mostly about my background, 
interests, technical skills and then I was presented with a mathematical/coding brain teaser question.

## What have I done right?
I have taken several online ML/AI classes from undergrad to grad level, so this is something that
potentially made me stand out within the niche I was interested in. I believe I started applying early,
which increased the number of companies I could apply to and given me more time to revise my CV and skills.
I have also used various channels for applying: official job listing, at conferences (NeurIPS in my case), 
through hackathon partners, emailing researchers/companies directly, and of course, trying my connections. I 
have also applied to positions that I did not meet the criteria for and I encourage you to do the same. If I hadn't, 
I wouldn't have applied to Canon who specified they were only looking for 3rd-year+ students and I would be without an offer right now. 
I cannot say I have nailed my CV, it still isn't particularly amazing, but I adapted it over time. My takeaway is to keep it 1 page 
only and to keep any technical descriptions high level. The idea is to get them interested enough to interview you. I also kept in mind 
the importance of algorithms and data structures.

## What have I done wrong?
I did not sufficiently focus on algorithms and data structures. While this may sound like a contradiction, it has
its purpose. Obviously, coding interviews are important. Of course, you would revise the typical Algorithms and Data structures. 
However, there is an appreciable difference between theory and coding it up under time pressure. I picked up a copy of Cracking the
coding interview book, which I have found very helpful, but similar texts will probably do just fine. This way I got familiar with typical 
coding questions and had a curated learning path as opposed to LeetCode/Hackerrank, which I find fine for practice, but not awfully good for 
learning the basics. Once familiar with the basics, feel free to use LeetCode/HackerRank for practice. I'd encourage you to make it a daily/bi-daily 
habit, as you will not have sufficient time to cram before a coding interview. And while it may seem arduous, I found LeetCode enjoyable-ish after a
while (Full disclosure, I stopped LeetCoding after I received an offer, so do as I say, not do as I do). Also, while O(n)  and O(2n) are asymptotically
the same, it makes a difference in a coding interview!

Another thing that I did not do well is my portfolio, or rather the lack of it. This will obviously depend on your niche, but 
you want to have something to show that you can code. Ideally, something visual and interactive, as you fight for the hiring manager's 
attention span and this will make your portfolio memorable. AI is a little complicated in this regard because most models are created and 
live in Jupyter notebooks only, which does not make for a great portfolio. I'd suggest learning some basics of web/app dev and turning your models
into something deployable and interactive. It does not need to be the greatest app.

## Is internship worth the effort?

I think you should try applying just for the sake of learning how the process works. If you give it enough time, you'll improve your
writing skills, and perhaps even improve your technical skills. While some people on the internet make it seem like getting an internship 
is easy peasy, trust me, it is not. There's a lot of frustration: Rejections without feedback, getting ghosted after an assessment that you 
thought you did great on, endless rounds of similar automated assessments, and so on... But perhaps this frustration is caused by my own lack of 
skills and you find it easy to get internships, in which case sincere congratulations to you. Let me in on the secret :)
